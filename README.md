# Reasoning
Anxiety and been up to the news.


# Process
I used collide2D library to assist with collision detection and 2 classes were created:
One to represent the cars, in this case Jared Kushner, Alex Jones, Stephen Miller and, for the lack of creativity, Fox and Friends, the second class was created to assist for the burger that has to avoid all of the cars and get to the president.


# Goal
Get the burger to the president. If you succeed 20 more seconds will be added to the time, otherwise, if you hit the cars, you lose one point.
After the time has passed the game is over.
